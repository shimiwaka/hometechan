This is a simple SNS created to study Ruby on Rails.

When I was on Twitter, I had some bad experiences with replies and retweets.

Therefore, the function of reply and retweet does not exist in this SNS.

Only the "homeru" (praise) function, which is equivalent to the "like" function, exists.

Due to server reasons, this service is no longer in operation and the code is now publicly available.
